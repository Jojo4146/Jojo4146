<h1>Johanna Emilien ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· </h1>
  <strong><code>Student of Computer Technology & Software Development</code><strong/>
  
  <p>I am a Valencia College student and an avid learner. My passion is computers but have little experience with programming. I am open to learning a bunch more.</p>
  <p>As an all-around learner, I have taken courses on C language, C++, C#, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make my transition into programming much easier. I know I should have "stick to one language" but I am still searching for the 'it' language. However, I have knowledge of Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. </p>
