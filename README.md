<h1>Johanna Emilien ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· </h1>
<strong><code>Student of Computer Technology & Software Development</code><strong/>
<p></p>
  <p>I am a Valencia College student, a healthcare professional and an avid learner. As an all-around learner, I have taken courses on several programming languages to make my transition into programming much easier. I know I should have "stock" to one language, but I am still searching for the 'it' language. </p>
<p>I am here because I am seeking to learn much more and because this is the best place to keep my work while I am in school. You can find my info at LinkedIn: <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/johanna-scharbaai-emilien-252366136/">Jojo</a></p>
