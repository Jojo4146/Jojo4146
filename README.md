<h1>Johanna Emilien ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· </h1>
  <strong><code>Student of Computer Technology & Software Development</code><strong/>
    <p></p>
  <p>I am a Valencia College student, a healthcare professional and an avid learner. As an all-around learner, I have taken courses on C language, C++, C#, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL and JavaScript to make my transition into programming much easier. I know I should have "stock" to one language, but I am still searching for the 'it' language. </p>
    <p>I am here because I am seeking to learn much more and because this is the best place to keep my work while I am in school. </p>
